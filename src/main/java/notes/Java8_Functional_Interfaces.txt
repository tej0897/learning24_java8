The new Functional Interfaces introduced in Java 8 are
    1. Consumer (bi-consumer)
    2. Producer (bi-producer)
    3. Predicate (bi-predicate)
    4. Function (Unary, Binary, bi-function)

                ************

Consumer:

Accept an input, perform some operation on that input.
    Example: Accept an input, perform Uppercase Operation on that input and print it.

How to use it?

    Consumer<String> consumer = (s) -> System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());

        now, with the reference variable consumer, we can use consumer.
        Consumer has two methods:
            1. accept
            2. andThen

        We use "accept" method to pass in the value.

    consumer.accept("java8");   // output: JAVA8
